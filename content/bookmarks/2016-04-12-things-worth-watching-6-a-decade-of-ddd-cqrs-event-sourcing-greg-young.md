I always enjoy watch Greg Young&#8217;s presentations. This one, <a href="http://dddeurope.com/2016/greg-young.html" target="_blank">from DDD-Europe 2016</a>, is very interesting as a retrospect of the changes DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing have permitted in how modeling problems are attacked and solved with these techniques, and what we can expect in the future.
