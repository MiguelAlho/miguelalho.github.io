    A Bounded Context is a boundary. It has it's own language within the boundary. There is a purpose to it, too - Reusability is not key concern. Models are specific.


    It can also be seen as team first boundary (Team Topologies space).


    The bounded context does not show the dynamics between contexts (nor between teams).

  title: On Conway's Law
  content: Conway's law is not about the org structure on the chart - it's about the dynamics in that org chart. It's about the communication structure.

  content: Context Maps are a bit of a hidden gem in the DDD space, since most look at the Tactical patterns immediaely.

    We're used to communicating between services using REST API synchronous call or consuming events. But we can see other types of communication. For instance, the propagation of models based on the messages passed back and forth is an effect. There is always some type of coupling.

  content: "Context Maps address a few concerns:\n\n* Dependencies between components and teams\n  * Mutually Dependent\n  * Free\n  * Upstream / Downstream (reflects on power dynamics: Upstream team normally has power over downstream teams)\n\n  "

  title: Open-host Service
  content: One API for several consumers. API provider (Open host provider) is generally Upstream. Rare cases where the Open-host service (power control) is downstream is in regulator related scenarios.

  title: Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)
  content: >-
    ACL is basically a model-to-model transformation. Downstream team uses ACL to transform external model into it's own.


    Be aware that is costs time and money.

  title: On Coupling
  content: >
    ACL is not about decoupling (because you can't) - it's about loose-coupling.

    Conformist is deep coupling

  title: Shared Kernel
  content: >-
    Shared Kernel physically shares an artifact. JARs, DLLs, DBs. It's considered an Anti-Pattern.


    If you want to autonomy, you want to avoid Shared Kernel.

  content: There's heuristics for it too. It can be a trade-off. Avoid it, for sure, if teams are in a competitive nature - it becomes toxic (politics).

  title: Published Language
  content: >-
    Standardized language in most cases. Creates independence between teams. Often combined with OHS.


    We'd expect that an OHS have a well documented interface and a well documented / defined language.
