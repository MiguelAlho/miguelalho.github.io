<a href="https://github.com/bethesque" target="_blank">Beth Skurrie</a>&#8216;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/pact" target="_blank">Pacts to The Rescue</a>&#8221; presentation at Sydney API Days 2015 is worth the watch to get an overview of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html" target="_blank">Consumer-Driven-Contracts</a> and the use of <a href="https://github.com/realestate-com-au/pact" target="_blank">Pact</a> to implement it. One thing I was missing, and that I hadn&#8217;t seen yet till watching this,  was the [Pact-Broker][1] &#8211; a centralized service to publish pacts to and consume them in the service providers. A .Net implementation of the broker would also be nice, just to simplify integration, modification and ramp-up. I don&#8217;t know of any implementation, but at least there is <a href="https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/pact-net" target="_blank">Pact-net</a> to use pacts in a .Net codebase, provided by SEEK-jobs.
