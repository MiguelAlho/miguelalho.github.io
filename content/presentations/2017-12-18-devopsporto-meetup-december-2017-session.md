![Me, presenting at the devopsporto meetup][1]

I recently presented a talk titled &#8220;Ramp Up Your Learning Habits in 2018&#8221; and intended to challenge the attendees of the December 2017 [DevopsPorto meetup][2] group to choose some topics and focus on learning them in 2018.

It was a fun presentation for me, given it is a topic dear to me and was also the first time I presented to the group I co-founded with <a href="https://www.eduardopiairo.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eduardo Piairo</a>.

The slides are available through GitPitch (which I also learned for this session) at <a href="https://gitpitch.com/MiguelAlho/LearningChallenge2018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://gitpitch.com/MiguelAlho/LearningChallenge2018</a>. Press &#8216;S&#8217; to open the speaker deck and find additional notes. The slides are open source and available at <a href="https://github.com/MiguelAlho/LearningChallenge2018" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/MiguelAlho/LearningChallenge2018</a> . In the repo, I also have a set of notes on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Britt-Andreatta/1106006-1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some Lynda.com courses by Britt Andreatta</a> about learning that I found useful and which can further aid any efforts to create new learning habits in 2018.

Finally, a quick thanks to all those who attended and followed up during the break and at the end of the day, and also thanks to my good friends at <a href="https://www.wearebitmaker.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bitmaker Software</a> for hosting the event at the awesome startup house <a href="http://www.founders-founders.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Founders 2 Founders</a>.
